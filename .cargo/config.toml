# Uncomment the line below to treat warnings as errors locally (matching CI)
# This will make your local builds fail on warnings, just like Linux/macOS CI does
rustflags = ["-D", "warnings"]

# Alternative: Only deny specific warning groups
# rustflags = ["-D", "unused-mut", "-D", "unused-variables"]
